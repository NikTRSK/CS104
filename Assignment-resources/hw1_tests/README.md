## CS 104: Spring 2016 Homework 1 Tests

The three folders in this directory contain the tests that were run for problems 4, 5, and 6 on Homework 1. 

Before raising a grading dispute, please copy these test files into your VM and run them against your program. In the event you would like to raise a grading dispute, create a new issue on GitHub by responding to the grade report you were issued. Assigning your grader to the issue and leave a comment explaining what you want regraded and what the error is. 

### Problem 4:

Each file with a `.cmd` extension contains input we tested against your program, and the corresponding `.out` file contains the expected output.

To run the tests for this problem, you can open the input files and enter their contents at the command line, or you can run your executable by redirecting input using the `<` operator at the command line. Then inspect the contents of the solution output files to check for a match.

### Problem 5:

Each file with a `.txt` extension contains input we tested against your program, and the corresponding `.out` file contains the expected output. 

To run the tests for this problem, feed the input files into your executable and check your output against the solution files. 

### Problem 6:

Each file with a `.in` extension contains input we tested against your program, and the corresponding `.out` file contains the expected output.

To run the tests for this problem, feed the input files into your executable and check your output against the solution files. 

**Note:** We performed a visual inspection of the output files for this problem, so your answers do not have to match exactly the contents of the solution files. We allowed for different formatting and various error messages so long as they made sense.
