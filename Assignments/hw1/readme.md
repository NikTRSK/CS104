#Homework 1

###Problem 1 & 2: Course policies & GIT
The answers are found in the **hw1.txt** file in the format: question followed by the correct answer.

###Problem 3: Review
Nothing to submit.

###Problem 4: Recursion and Streams
Palindrome fixed.

###Problem 5: Streams
Dynamic memory used for the streams.
To compile:
`g++ -g -Wall hw1q5.cpp -o hw1q5`
* Wall used to show all warnings

To run:
`./hw1q5 input_file`

###Problem 6: Strings and Dynamic Memory
To compile:
`g++ -g -Wall tommytrojan.cpp -o tommytrojan`
* Wall used to show all warnings

To run:
`./tommytrojan input_file output_file`

**Note:** currently trying to use 0 for input. Ex. `MOVEIN 1 0` would be a problem but Prof. Cote specified that this is not a case we should worry about, therefore it is unaccounted for.
